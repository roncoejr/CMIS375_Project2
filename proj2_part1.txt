BIG BLUE LOOKED TO BIG RED -- IBM received great publicity when its 
Deep Blue chess machine beat the world chess champion, Gary Kasparov.
Deep Blue is a supercomputer that runs on the IBM AIX version of the 
UNIX system.  After the computer won the second game of the match, the
head of the IBM team introduced to the audience his consultant and the
creator of UNIX, Lucent's legendary Dennis Ritchie. The audience gave 
Ritchie a standing ovation.  Maybe Bell Labs should get its deserved
share of publicity in this man vs. machine hyperbole.
