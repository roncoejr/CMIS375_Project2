Tim created the Module List in August 1994 and maintained it manually till 
April 1996. By that time Andreas had implemented the Perl Authors Upload 
Server (PAUSE) and it was happily feeding modules through to the CPAN archive sites.
Since PAUSE held a database of module information which could be maintained by module authors
it made sense for the module listing part of the Module List to be built 
from that database. In April 1996 Andreas took over the automatic posting of 
the Module List and I now maintain the other parts of the text. We plan to add 
value to the automation over time.
